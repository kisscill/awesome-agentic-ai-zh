⏱ **Time estimate**: 1-2 weeks (~8-15 hours)

After your CLI runs smoothly, the next step: **wire it into your real workflow**. MCP server integration, CI automation, cost / observability. After this stop, the CLI is no longer just your personal tool — it's part of your team's workflow.

## 📌 Learning Goals

- Connect 1-3 MCP servers to your CLI (Slack / Gmail / internal API / DB)
- Set up GitHub Actions to auto-run Claude Code (PR review, release notes, etc.)
- Add observability (trace, cost, latency) to CLI workflows
- Plan a cost budget — know roughly what a big task costs in tokens

## 🛠 Hands-on Exercises

### Exercise CLI-9: MCP server connected to CLI
Following [Stage 5.2 Exercise: MCP client](../../stages/05-claude-code-ecosystem.en.md#hello-x), connect at least one useful MCP server to your CLI:
- `filesystem` server → let the CLI read files outside its default scope
- `github` server → let it read PRs / issues directly
- Custom server → connect your internal API / DB

Success: in a CLI conversation, ask "does my PR have conflicts?" and have the CLI answer via MCP (without you opening a browser).

### Exercise CLI-10: GitHub Actions + CLI
Write `.github/workflows/cli-review.yml`:
- Trigger: PR opened / synchronize
- Run: in the GH Actions runner, execute Claude Code (or Codex), feed it `git diff` + your `.claude/commands/review.md`
- Output: PR comment

Success: open a new PR, see a review comment within 1-2 minutes.

> Starting points: Anthropic's official [`claude-code-action`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action); Codex has GitHub App and CLI modes.

### Exercise CLI-11: Cost tracking
Run a daily task. **Predict** the token usage first, then actually run it and check the usage. The gap is usually big (you typically underestimate).
- Math: input tokens + output tokens × model price each
- Connect langfuse or Helicone ([Stage 7 Observability](../../stages/07-multi-agent-production.en.md#observability)) for tracing
- Observe: which sub-task consumes the most tokens? Are you sending unnecessary long context?

### Exercise CLI-12: Skill / plugin team sharing
Package your `.claude/commands/` and `CLAUDE.md` into a plugin, publish to internal marketplace or GitHub. Teammates `claude plugin install` and get the same workflow.
- Skill / plugin details in [Stage 5.3 + 5.4](../../stages/05-claude-code-ecosystem.en.md)

## ✅ Track A Full Self-Check

Can you:
- [ ] Have at least 1 MCP server connected to your daily CLI
- [ ] Have at least 1 CI workflow auto-running a CLI agent
- [ ] State the rough token / cost / latency for some specific task you run
- [ ] Packaged your CLAUDE.md / commands at least once (even just for yourself)
- [ ] Know which tasks deserve observability and which don't

If yes → **Track A complete**. Pick a [specialized branch](../../README.en.md#️-learning-map-two-tracks) and continue (researcher / developer / teacher / knowledge-worker / everyday-users).

If you want to go deeper into "**how to write your own CLI agent**" (not use existing) → jump to [Track B Stage 3](../../stages/03-tool-use-and-hello-agent.en.md). Track A and Track B are complementary.

## 💡 What's Next

After Track A you're a CLI power user. Next phase choices:

1. **Deepen CLI workflow** (keep refining your setup)
   - Subscribe to Anthropic / OpenAI changelogs
   - Quarterly review of [`resources/cli-agents-guide.en.md`](../../resources/cli-agents-guide.en.md) for new tools
   - Share CLAUDE.md / skills with your team

2. **Cross to Track B** (learn to write your own agent)
   - Stage 3-4: tool use + frameworks
   - Stage 5: deep dive into Claude Code internals
   - Stage 7: write your own multi-agent system

3. **Walk a specialized branch** (apply CLI to a specific domain)
   - Researcher / developer / knowledge-worker / teacher / everyday-users
   - Each branch uses what you learned in Track A
